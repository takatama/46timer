## 4:6 Method
The 4:6 method is a coffee brewing technique developed by World Brewers Cup Champion Tetsu Kasuya. It involves dividing the water into two parts: 40% for the first two pours and 60% for the last three pours. This method allows you to control the strength and taste of your coffee by adjusting the amount of water in each pour.
